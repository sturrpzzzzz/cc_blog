My work responds to [Sabato Visconti's #Glitchbooth](https://www.sabatobox.com/glitchbooth). While my work was inspired by his work, there are some contradictions between mine and his. #Glitchbooth is an installation where participants have their best selves captured and processed into gliches artworks. My work focuses on a fragmented sense of self instead of the participant's best self, because that was the first thing I thought of when I saw this work: gliched, incomplete versions of people. I find #Glitchbooth a creative, admirable way to help people appreciate their imperfect, incomplete, "error" selves, but at the same time, the way every person looks simulated, processed, kind of inhuman, makes me a little unnerved. Driven by my initial impression of his work, my work portrays a fragmented sense of self - quite literally - because I will be portraying someone who is not in control of their mind. However, I find the fact that they were open about their mistake and their determination not to get into the same situation again admirable, because they accepted the fact that they made mistakes - or glitched - and were evolving into their better self by improving themself. 

To achieve chaos in my sketch, I used A LOT of `random()`. I also used noise in my background, combined with random letters. I combined different layers of (kinda) organised chaos, so chaos stacked on top of chaos results in even more chaos. Each frame never provides the same result due to the randomisation of letter, colours,  and cells and lines movements. I also utilised `map()` to have the artwork correspond the mouse position, which means every different mouse coord produces a different result.
