## What is cute?

From my research and Sienna Ngai's book, cuteness refers to the "look" of objects that come across as appealingly powerless, soft, malleable and diminutive. It is an aesthetic evaluation, one that seems primarily positive but ultimately ambivalent: it can be either dissmissive or a compliment.

In design, cuteness refers to a design approach that uses elements that portray senses of softness, innocence, amiable, vulnerable, and maybe even inferior in my opinion. The elements often include:
    1 - Soft textures, rounded shapes and curves to create comfort
    2 - Vibrant, cheerful colours, including pastels, since they evoke a sense of softness and innocence
    3 - Lively, dynamic, energetic expressions
    4 - Clean, simple designs
Anime is the prime example of cuteness in design. Most cute characters have big eyes, really expressive facial expressions, dynamic actions, and rounded faces. 

## What is effective complexity?

To understand what effective complexity is, I believe I should break down what each word means. So

### What is complexity?

Complexity refers to the state of being intricate, multifaceted, or having many different parts that are connected or codependent on each other in a non-linear, complicated way.

In science, complexity is a study on how a large collection of components can spontaneously self-organise to exhibit global structures and behaviours at larger scales.

### What is effective?

Effective means being successful in producing a desired or intended result.

> Something I wonder about is why it is not called efficient complexity but effective complexity, because efficient is about achieving the intended result without waste, while effective is about achieving the intended result in whatever way possible, and yet from what I have read about effective complexity, it is about conciseness and simplicity.

### What is effective complexity?

A few things that I noted down from Murray Gell-Mann's "What is complexity?":
According to Murray Gell-Mann, complexity refers to the length of the shortest message conveying certain information. Effective complexity is the concise description of a set of the entity's regularities. Quantity cannot be used to measure complexity, and something that is completely random has the effective complexity of 0. Effective complexity can be high in only a region intermediate between total order and complete disorder.

> Just a side note that I thought this was an awesome read. I'm deeply fascinated by quantum physics and the idea of limitless multiverses where limitless things are happening all at once.

In my words, effective complexity is basically using concise and simplified resources to convey an abundance of information. The diversity and richness of the information goes hand in hand with the simplicity of its description.

## What is generative art?

Generative art is an algorithm that includes parameters allowing the automatic generation of unpredictable results while still following a defined set of rules. This leads to different outcomes every time the artwork is generated.

## What is effective complexity in generative art?

It refers to the diversity and intricacy of the generated artworks, considering the differences between the complexity of the algorithms and the simplicity of the result while still retaining the aesthetic and appeal.

# AT1 Journey

The RR work I decided to respond to is [whywashesad](https://www.whywashesad.com).

## Why is this cute?

The website's colour scheme consists of a very bright, saturated blue and white - colours of the clear sky. As the human brain tends to expand on what they are thinking of, when I think of the blue sky, I think of joy and warmth - people outside playing, having fun, birds chirping, etc. The high-pitched, cartoonish sounds add a sense of silliness and light-heartedness (if that is a word, but you get what I mean). The abundance of curves and rounded shapes also contribute in the cuteness, as the clouds seem, and are so harmless, soft, and reminds me of squishiness for some reason. 

## What would I like to retain or change?

I want to keep the silly sounds, as it adds a lot more dimension to the interaction in my opinion. I think sounds are one of the most important parts of designs, as there is always noise around us no matter what, and any piece of design that I like always evokes some kind of sound in my head. For example, the [Mountain Dew poster for Halloween 2020](https://www.flowerstales.com/2020/10/halloween-treats-mystery-mountain-dew.html) made me think of a very funky, spooky tunes, similar to the song [Somebody's Watching Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvAYIJSSZY) (this is not a Rick Roll don't worry).

Another thing I would like to keep is the shape of the clouds. They "feel" so soft and bouncy. 

I am all about interactivity and I would definitely prefer more interactions in my website. I know it's RR's style to make the website simple, yet his code must be complex as hell because I have no idea how he does it half the time. Anyway, I would add more things to interact with, maybe add a sun that randomly appears behind the clouds, or add more colours to the website, like a gradient background or slightly different hues of blue for the clouds.

## Idea development

The clouds popping reminds me of bubbles popping, so I thought might as well make bubbles in my website, because bubbles are more fun and sillier (in my opinion), and I can use a wider range of colours. But, instead of popping the bubbles, I want to create more bubbles because the more bubbles the better, and I don't want to just straight up remake his website.

Like I said, RR's website reminds me of activities on a bright, sunny day. I want to add some background basically. Trees and flowers maybe? They can be cute, but I like to have a character that I can interact with and respond to me, so it feels a little more personal and lively. When it comes to cuteness, I feel like the easiest way to make it is to create a silly, lovable character anyway. For the sake of simplicity, I want my character to be a simple, rounded shape, with one big, expressive eye, like Mike Wazowski from Monster Inc. The effective complexity comes into play regarding the way you are able to interact with the character. Let's call him Womp (womp). As your mouse gets closer to Womp, he gets increasingly annoyed. You are basically invading his personal space (how could you).

For the techniques, I'm using conditional operators along with short-circuit evaluations to change Womp's expressions and make my code more concise and easier to read. I'm using a few array methods and classes to work on the bubbles. 
Honestly, I'm not sure what counts as a Javascript technique and what doesn't. I just use whatever it requires to make my codes work...

My design concept will be talked about in my journal for my development process of assignment 1.
