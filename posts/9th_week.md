# I HEARD TALKING IS DANGEROUS.

I. Mycelial Creativity

    1. Networking: Just like how mycelium creates an interconnected network, this project (quite literally) connects and communicates with people in one of the most uncertain times of our lives.
    2. Adaptability: Mycelium is extremely adaptive, capable of growing in various harsh conditions. Similarly, this project can be adapted in any situation and used as ideas for future projects that allow people to communicate with each other in the future.
    3. Underground Growth: Much of the mycelium's growth happens unseen, until it grows into mushrooms. In this project, a lot of the initial workâ€”brainstorming and experimenting happens behind the scenes, as the artist needed to take into consideration the risks of talking to each other physically and how to resolve that problem.

II. Aesthetic interesting

According to Sienna Ngai, the tinteresting is about capturing and sustaining attention over time. Unlike the immediate impact of beauty or the overwhelming nature of the sublime, the interesting invites ongoing consideration and reflection.

Capturing and sustaining attention is one of the basics of communication. Ngai also links the interesting to the dissemination of information and the processing of novelty. It is associated with things that are new, different, or complex enough to provoke curiosity and thought. What is fascinating to me is how physical communication was taken for granted, because that was what everybody was doing everyday until COVID. The beauty of this project lies on the way with such a simple idea, Lauren has managed to sustain everyone's attention and created such a novel concept, since communication is such a mundane task that no one even takes it into consideration to find ways to safely physically communicate.

The interesting arises in contexts where mediation and discourse are involved, where discussion, debate, and exchange of ideas are encouraged. Communication is the main way to exchange information.

The interesting is interdisciplinary, bridging aesthetics, media theory, and cultural studies. It is relevant in various fields, from literature and art to science and everyday life. Communication is evident in every aspect of daily lives.

# Brainstorm

For my AT3, I am choosing my music event attendees community. My domain lies on the location of the physical events. We share the same love for the music genre and support for the artists that we listen to. We also share the interest in having fun and socialising. Repertoire exists in the performance of the music itself, and the visualisations of the music, whether auditorial, light visuals, or the theme of the event overall. 

I want to create an audio visualiser for the electronic music events that I am attending. For all music events, especially electronic music ones, audio visualisers are extremely important, as they create tangible images and visualisations of the beats in addition to the listening to the music itself.
