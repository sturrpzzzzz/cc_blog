I'm not really sure how implementing them in my blog post works, so I just made individual sketches... Sorry......

# three.js

It took a while for me to understand how three.js works, since I have never worked with 3D objects before. However, after snooping around and seeing some other people's three.js sketches, I think I kinda got it :D

# C2.js

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to make a c2.js sketch this week. I will make one as soon as I have time, I just hope that I don't completely forget about it...
